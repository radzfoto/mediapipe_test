Instructions:
Create a node-red graph generating all the necessary json code.
Each node can be implemented in any language and any framework you choose
provided it meets with the requirements specifed below. Write all the 
necessary code for a full implementation. You can assume a computer with
the Linux operating system will be the platform.
Requirements:
1. read video from a webcam in real-time
2. perform hand landmark detection in real-time
3. Display the hand landmarks as drawings or overlays on the webcam video
4. Design the nodes flexibly so that the hand landmark algorithm can be changed to a face detection and object detection model in future.
5. Provide clear instructions on how to install the necessary software and run the application
