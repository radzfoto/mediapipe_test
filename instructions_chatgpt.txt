You are a python expert programming on Ubuntu linux. Please write ALL the code necessary to perform the following tasks. Generate only the code without any explanations:
1. Setup and configure a webcam
2. Continuously capture video frames from the webcam and pass them one by one to a method that will perform hand landmark detection
3. Pass the hand landmark information for each video frame to a method that will draw the landmarks on the video frame as pass the video frame to another method that will display them
4. Write a method that will display each video frame in real-time in a window

I found some errors and after digging around the mediapipe repo, I found that some files and directories have been moved. Please use the follow imports to get access to hands, drawing_utils, and vision:
from mediapipe.python.solutions.hands import Hands
import mediapipe.python.solutions.drawing_utils as drawing_utils
from mediapipe.tasks.python import vision

ChatGPT:
Certainly! Here's the updated code with the corrected import statements according to your provided paths from the MediaPipe repository:

Me:
Unfortunately, Google has also changed mediapipe in an inconsistent way. HAND_CONNECTIONS should be a tuple, but it's actually class now, but not all methods have been fixed for that including hand_landmarks, so you will need to extract the hand connections by creating your own tuple list from HAND_CONNECTIONS

ChatGPT:
Understood. To accommodate the changes in the MediaPipe library, where HAND_CONNECTIONS is now a class but not fully integrated in all methods, we can create our own tuple list from HAND_CONNECTIONS. Here's the updated code with this adjustment:
Generated code
This code now manually constructs the hand_connections tuple from the HAND_CONNECTIONS class, ensuring compatibility with the current state of the MediaPipe library.

ME:
Still doesn't work: you will need to get HAND_CONNECTIONS from the vision.HandLandmarksConnections class

ChatGPT:
Thank you for the clarification. Let's update the code to extract HAND_CONNECTIONS from vision.HandLandmarksConnections as per the latest changes in the MediaPipe library:
Generated code
This code should now correctly use the HAND_CONNECTIONS from vision.HandLandmarkConnections.

ME:

This did not work either. For some unknown reason, you have to import:from mediapipe.tasks.python import vision
[Actually, I was wrong. This was actually a mistake I made. ChatGPT will fix it later on.]

ME:
I apologize for the confusion earlier. Let's adjust the import statement to correctly import vision from mediapipe.tasks.python. Here's the updated code:

ChatGPT:
This should now correctly use vision from mediapipe.tasks.python and set up HAND_CONNECTIONS properly.

ME:
Sorry, I made a type. It should be HandLandmarksConnections throughout. Also, shouldn't hand_connect be a list of two item tuples?
[I didn't realize it at the time, but this was not my typo. It was ChatGPT that changed the class name incorrectly.]

ChatGPT
No problem, let's correct the code with the right import for HandLandmarksConnections and ensure that hand_connections is a list of two-item tuples. Here's the updated code:
Generated code
This code correctly imports HandLandmarksConnections and creates a list of two-item tuples for hand_connections, which should align with the current MediaPipe library's structure and usage.

ME:
HandLandmarksConnections does not have a method called get_default(). Here is the correct code to get the list of tuples for HAND_CONNECTIONS:
def get_hand_connections_as_tuples(connections: list) -> list[tuple[int, int]]:
    # Convert each Connection object into a tuple and add to the list
    connections_tuples: list[tuple[int, int]] = [(conn.start, conn.end) for conn in connections]
    return connections_tuples

# Initialize MediaPipe Hands.
hand_connections: list = vision.HandLandmarksConnections.HAND_CONNECTIONS
hand_connections: list = get_hand_connections_as_tuples(hand_connections)
[This was difficult. The bug is caused by an internal inconsistency in the mediapipe source code that took me about 2 hours to figure out and workaround.]

ChatGPT:
Thank you for providing the correct code to get the HAND_CONNECTIONS as a list of tuples. Here's the revised code with your provided function and usage:
Generated code
With this update, the hand_connections should now be correctly set up as a list of tuples, and the code should work with the latest changes in the MediaPipe library.

[THIS CODE FINALLY WORKED!!!]
